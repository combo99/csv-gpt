# csv-gpt
Upload CSV file and GPT will answer questions about it (cant do tasks yet)

streamlit run main.py (inside terminal - set directory to this folder)

With this program you can just upload some csv file and ask questions (answered using GPT api)

Can't do complex tasks (only questions rn) - Upload your OpenAI Key in the .env file

Enjoy, again, this isn't anything serious or complex
